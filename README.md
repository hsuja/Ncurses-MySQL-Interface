# Ncurses-MySQL-Interface

This project was implemented with Alan Grubb and Michael Sigel in a 3-person team. 

The project is a Ncurses based interface to interact with a MySQL database. The user is able to create new users, create/modify databases, and create/modify tables in a quasi graphical interface.
